 <p class="text-white">Swedish-born actress Katherine Galanova plays the sexy, vulnerable, Mika in the horror film being shot within True Drama. Katherine explains,“This is a horror film - I scream - I beg - I run for my life - but this is also a critique of horror films. True Drama questions and recreates reality at the same time. It does this by taking on the original purpose of drama - from when drama was first invented - way back in ancient Greece.  Another thing I learned from the director, James Thomas, is the way that large center-stage doors are used in Greek drama to foretell something ominous. You hear screaming off set and they wheel out the dead bodies. My scenes involve four sets of unexpected doors - okay no spoilers but I’ll say that the shower-room has a very heavy metal door - and the whole game with doors plays right up through the climax of the film."</p>

aside: 'Strange Bacchic disturbances in the woods protesting a local horror movie prompt a police investigation. A shadowy figure emerges.  Calling himself the God of Drama, he believes that he can achieve the seemingly impossible goal of returning drama to its original purpose – of preparing citizens for leadership in democracy. As the horror movie spirals out of control, and the Bacchae are consumed in violence - can officer Ailish Walsh discern the truth before a gruesome Greek drama unfolds? <br><br> Director James Thomas creates a Greek tragedy for our time. A horror story that looks at the original role of drama – as the companion invention of democracy – to shed light on how modern media is still working in our lives, in hidden ways, to rip us apart. True Drama is an alarm – a rare moment of clarity – a terrifying jolt - and an invitation to enjoy the true transcendental power of drama to help us envision a better Democracy. '
