 <p class="text-white">Melissa Croy is a newbie to the world of film but with a long list of theater credits she was immediately enticed by the concept of True Drama. “The Hamlet-esque, play-within-a-play storytelling of True Drama, really caught me,” explains Melissa, “It’s an interesting look into the pedagogical origins of drama. Along the way, we discover that the real tragedy is in the degradation of performance art into insensitive reality-based crime reenactments.  My character is introduced as Victim #2,” she laughs. “It’s a deliciously ironic play on the trope and an actress so desperately committed to her craft that she would accept any part – kind of hits home because, of course, I would. Victim #2 is a great part. But it was doubly fun to do this in a smart film that’s also struggling to captures the essence of true drama.”</p>

aside: 'Strange Bacchic disturbances in the woods protesting a local horror movie prompt a police investigation. A shadowy figure emerges.  Calling himself the God of Drama, he believes that he can achieve the seemingly impossible goal of returning drama to its original purpose – of preparing citizens for leadership in democracy. As the horror movie spirals out of control, and the Bacchae are consumed in violence - can officer Ailish Walsh discern the truth before a gruesome Greek drama unfolds? <br><br> Director James Thomas creates a Greek tragedy for our time. A horror story that looks at the original role of drama – as the companion invention of democracy – to shed light on how modern media is still working in our lives, in hidden ways, to rip us apart. True Drama is an alarm – a rare moment of clarity – a terrifying jolt - and an invitation to enjoy the true transcendental power of drama to help us envision a better Democracy. '
