 <p class="text-white">Liam explains, “I play Officer Roberts in True Drama. He’s arrives to support Officer Walsh in her pursuit of a suspect, and everything goes wrong.  After a suspension, I’m back on the job just in time to save the day.  My character arc is the same as Officer Walsh. We encounter something incomprehensible – have a transcendental experience – and come out transformed.”</p>

aside: 'Strange Bacchic disturbances in the woods protesting a local horror movie prompt a police investigation. A shadowy figure emerges.  Calling himself the God of Drama, he believes that he can achieve the seemingly impossible goal of returning drama to its original purpose – of preparing citizens for leadership in democracy. As the horror movie spirals out of control, and the Bacchae are consumed in violence - can officer Ailish Walsh discern the truth before a gruesome Greek drama unfolds? <br><br> Director James Thomas creates a Greek tragedy for our time. A horror story that looks at the original role of drama – as the companion invention of democracy – to shed light on how modern media is still working in our lives, in hidden ways, to rip us apart. True Drama is an alarm – a rare moment of clarity – a terrifying jolt - and an invitation to enjoy the true transcendental power of drama to help us envision a better Democracy. '
