 <p class="text-white">Bill Cozy is the Professor in True Drama. “My character is tapped by the police to give background on Dionysos,” Bill explains, “so the Professor lays out how drama was invented at the same time as democracy.  He explains how the two inventions were created to work together. This is a very important film – it gives you the opportunity to look at the whole enterprise of drama in a new way. We’ve all need to be invested in our democracy and drama is a tool that can help.” </p>

aside: 'Strange Bacchic disturbances in the woods protesting a local horror movie prompt a police investigation. A shadowy figure emerges.  Calling himself the God of Drama, he believes that he can achieve the seemingly impossible goal of returning drama to its original purpose – of preparing citizens for leadership in democracy. As the horror movie spirals out of control, and the Bacchae are consumed in violence - can officer Ailish Walsh discern the truth before a gruesome Greek drama unfolds? <br><br> Director James Thomas creates a Greek tragedy for our time. A horror story that looks at the original role of drama – as the companion invention of democracy – to shed light on how modern media is still working in our lives, in hidden ways, to rip us apart. True Drama is an alarm – a rare moment of clarity – a terrifying jolt - and an invitation to enjoy the true transcendental power of drama to help us envision a better Democracy. '
