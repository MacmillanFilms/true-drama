Alanah Rafferty’s background in independent film, the blogosphere, and on stage, made her a natural choice to play Sara Pullin – the LA movie Star and fanatical Bacchae. “I was very drawn to this script because it’s visceral – this is a horror movie in service of asking the question, ‘Why violence against women?’ And I loved playing a Bacchae. The Bacchae in this film are kind of special. The Bacchae by Euripides gives you a picture of female strength, ferocity and a connection with nature. But here – for the first time – we get to see their smarts – they are the guides to bring you into the world of the classics and the full world of our intellectual inheritance. So they’re physically strong – and they are mentally formidable. I would say – the Bacchae are the prime protagonists in this story.  It’s their rage at senseless violence that causes them to summon Dionysos. I don’t have to tell you how fun it is an actress to play the victim and the prime agent – all in service of creating a new kind of cinema.
