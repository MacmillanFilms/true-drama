quote: 
article: 'As an Amherst College and recent Actors Studio MFA graduate, Tatiana was
  a natural choice to take on the role of rooky Officer Walsh. Tatiana explains, “True
  Drama is two feature films happening at the same time. Walsh’s journey is a journey
  to find the truth – something we are all wrestling with these days.  The kind of
  solutions that she uses – the kind of answers that investigative police use: carefully
  collecting evidence, facts, firsthand testimony – these are exactly the right approach
  we need in our lives. But there’s something else also going on in this film – it’s
  a Greek drama. The feature has also within it, all the elements – a prologue, an
  agon, an exodus – and the effect of this is to shift the paradigm from entertainment
  to preparing citizens. This film upends how we think about violence in drama. Actors
  today are kind of marginalized – it’s somehow not a serious profession – and this
  film kind of flips that on its head – gets you to realize that it’s a fantastically
  serious undertaking – an essential part of Democracy – the twin invention of Democracy.
  This is why I want into acting.'
aside: "Strange Bacchic disturbances in the woods protesting a local horror movie
  prompt a police investigation. A shadowy figure emerges.  Calling himself the God
  of Drama, he believes that he can achieve the seemingly impossible goal of returning
  drama to its original purpose – of preparing citizens for leadership in democracy.
  As the horror movie spirals out of control, and the Bacchae are consumed in violence
  - can officer Ailish Walsh discern the truth before a gruesome Greek drama unfolds?\n<br>\n\nDirector
  James Thomas creates a Greek tragedy for our time. A horror story that looks at
  the original role of drama – as the companion invention of democracy – to shed light
  on how modern media is still working in our lives, in hidden ways, to rip us apart.
  True Drama is an alarm – a rare moment of clarity – a terrifying jolt - and an invitation
  to enjoy the true transcendental power of drama to help us envision a better Democracy. "
