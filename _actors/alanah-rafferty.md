 <p class="text-white">Alanah Rafferty's background in independent film, the blogosphere, and on stage, made her a natural choice to play Sara Pullin – the LA movie Star and Bacchae. "I was very drawn to this script because it's visceral – this is a horror movie in service of asking the question, 'Why violence against women?' And I loved playing a Bacchae. The Bacchae in this film are special. The Bacchae in Euripides are strong, ferocious and connected with nature. But here – for the first time – we get to see their smarts – they are the guides to bring you into the world of the classics and the full world of our intellectual inheritance. They're physically strong – and, they are mentally formidable. I would say, the Bacchae are the prime protagonists in this story.  It's their rage at senseless violence that causes them to summon Dionysos. I don’t have to tell you how fun it is as an actress to play the victim and the prime agent – all in service of creating a new kind of cinema."</p>

aside: 'Strange Bacchic disturbances in the woods protesting a local horror movie prompt a police investigation. A shadowy figure emerges.  Calling himself the God of Drama, he believes that he can achieve the seemingly impossible goal of returning drama to its original purpose – of preparing citizens for leadership in democracy. As the horror movie spirals out of control, and the Bacchae are consumed in violence - can officer Ailish Walsh discern the truth before a gruesome Greek drama unfolds? <br><br> Director James Thomas creates a Greek tragedy for our time. A horror story that looks at the original role of drama – as the companion invention of democracy – to shed light on how modern media is still working in our lives, in hidden ways, to rip us apart. True Drama is an alarm – a rare moment of clarity – a terrifying jolt - and an invitation to enjoy the true transcendental power of drama to help us envision a better Democracy. '
