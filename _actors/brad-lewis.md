 <p class="text-white">Brad studied at LiatBein in Tel Aviv, Israel, before studying in New York at HB Studio and Lee Strasberg. He played a Greenwich Police Detectivein a scene next to the Chief of Police and he also got the play the God of Drama on stage during scene blocking. Brad Explains, “I really enjoyed playing Dionysos – it’s just a different world behind that mask – you feel bigger than life. It’s a different kind of acting. The slightest head move changes the shadows on the mask and creates expressiveness. And the way the other performers react to you is just incredible.”</p>

aside: 'Strange Bacchic disturbances in the woods protesting a local horror movie prompt a police investigation. A shadowy figure emerges.  Calling himself the God of Drama, he believes that he can achieve the seemingly impossible goal of returning drama to its original purpose – of preparing citizens for leadership in democracy. As the horror movie spirals out of control, and the Bacchae are consumed in violence - can officer Ailish Walsh discern the truth before a gruesome Greek drama unfolds? <br><br> Director James Thomas creates a Greek tragedy for our time. A horror story that looks at the original role of drama – as the companion invention of democracy – to shed light on how modern media is still working in our lives, in hidden ways, to rip us apart. True Drama is an alarm – a rare moment of clarity – a terrifying jolt - and an invitation to enjoy the true transcendental power of drama to help us envision a better Democracy. '
