 <p class="text-white">Taylor Brandon is a graduate of Hofstra University the William Esper Studio in NYC. He plays Ray Wax, the head of movie security, in True Drama. It’s a job that keeps him up at night because as he explains to Officer Walsh, “Movies like this, bring out the nuts.” Taylor explains, “This is a smart film that blurs the lines between movie violence and real violence to get you thinking about the role drama should play. I loved playing the terrified head of security.”  </p>

aside: 'Strange Bacchic disturbances in the woods protesting a local horror movie prompt a police investigation. A shadowy figure emerges.  Calling himself the God of Drama, he believes that he can achieve the seemingly impossible goal of returning drama to its original purpose – of preparing citizens for leadership in democracy. As the horror movie spirals out of control, and the Bacchae are consumed in violence - can officer Ailish Walsh discern the truth before a gruesome Greek drama unfolds? <br><br> Director James Thomas creates a Greek tragedy for our time. A horror story that looks at the original role of drama – as the companion invention of democracy – to shed light on how modern media is still working in our lives, in hidden ways, to rip us apart. True Drama is an alarm – a rare moment of clarity – a terrifying jolt - and an invitation to enjoy the true transcendental power of drama to help us envision a better Democracy. '
