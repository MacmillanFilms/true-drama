 <p class="text-white">Christopher is a writer and actor who has appeared in many music theater and Greek dramas, including Lysistrata and Prometheus Bound. With perfect 800 Math and English SAT, he was an obvious choice to play the quick-witted Jack in True Drama. Jack is romantically involved with the star Sara Pullin in the film.  She tells him how to get cast as a slasher in the film so that they can be together. Jack explains, “His motivation is to keep his girlfriend safe on a production where violent things are happening. What’s interesting about True Drama is that you never know what’s going to happen next – it breaks all the molds. By looking way back to the beginning of drama in Ancient Greece, it gives us a new look at what drama can do today.”</p>

aside: 'Strange Bacchic disturbances in the woods protesting a local horror movie prompt a police investigation. A shadowy figure emerges.  Calling himself the God of Drama, he believes that he can achieve the seemingly impossible goal of returning drama to its original purpose – of preparing citizens for leadership in democracy. As the horror movie spirals out of control, and the Bacchae are consumed in violence - can officer Ailish Walsh discern the truth before a gruesome Greek drama unfolds? <br><br> Director James Thomas creates a Greek tragedy for our time. A horror story that looks at the original role of drama – as the companion invention of democracy – to shed light on how modern media is still working in our lives, in hidden ways, to rip us apart. True Drama is an alarm – a rare moment of clarity – a terrifying jolt - and an invitation to enjoy the true transcendental power of drama to help us envision a better Democracy. '
