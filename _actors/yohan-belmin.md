 <p class="text-white">Yohan Belmin graduated from the Lee Strasberg Theatre & Film Institute and has a master’s degree from Paris Dauphine University. “I love playing villains,” Yohan explains, “The slashers in True Drama are a dark reflection of Dionysos – his descendants fallen very low.  Instead of trying to elevate, our mission is to spread depravity.  This movie is a kind of meta-Greek drama exposing the downward trajectory of modern film – the inevitable by-product of seeking ever-greater thrills to shock.  I think it’s essential to question the role of drama. It is just entertainment? Or is it about preparing people?”</p>

aside: 'Strange Bacchic disturbances in the woods protesting a local horror movie prompt a police investigation. A shadowy figure emerges.  Calling himself the God of Drama, he believes that he can achieve the seemingly impossible goal of returning drama to its original purpose – of preparing citizens for leadership in democracy. As the horror movie spirals out of control, and the Bacchae are consumed in violence - can officer Ailish Walsh discern the truth before a gruesome Greek drama unfolds? <br><br> Director James Thomas creates a Greek tragedy for our time. A horror story that looks at the original role of drama – as the companion invention of democracy – to shed light on how modern media is still working in our lives, in hidden ways, to rip us apart. True Drama is an alarm – a rare moment of clarity – a terrifying jolt - and an invitation to enjoy the true transcendental power of drama to help us envision a better Democracy. '
