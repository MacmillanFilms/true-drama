 <p class="text-white">Jae plays Detective Jay Kim and shares an office with detective Oliva. Jonathan explains, “Oliva is struggling with a rookie officer who’s having a hard time respecting boundaries. She’s falling under the influence of a suspect - a cult leader called Dionysos. We did improvisation along those lines and when we do the longer serial version of True Drama, you’ll get to see more of the mysterious Detective Jay. In the play, ‘The Bacchae’ you learn that Dionysos is the god of panic fear in battle. And in True Drama the police officers have to deal with the trauma of encountering the god of panic fear.”</p>

aside: 'Strange Bacchic disturbances in the woods protesting a local horror movie prompt a police investigation. A shadowy figure emerges.  Calling himself the God of Drama, he believes that he can achieve the seemingly impossible goal of returning drama to its original purpose – of preparing citizens for leadership in democracy. As the horror movie spirals out of control, and the Bacchae are consumed in violence - can officer Ailish Walsh discern the truth before a gruesome Greek drama unfolds? <br><br> Director James Thomas creates a Greek tragedy for our time. A horror story that looks at the original role of drama – as the companion invention of democracy – to shed light on how modern media is still working in our lives, in hidden ways, to rip us apart. True Drama is an alarm – a rare moment of clarity – a terrifying jolt - and an invitation to enjoy the true transcendental power of drama to help us envision a better Democracy. '
