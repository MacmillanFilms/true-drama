 <p class="text-white">Buck Biestek(<i>Bloodlust</i> and <i>Arsenic and Old Lace</i>) - was a shoe-in to play the retired FBI agent in True Drama. “I’m very comfortable in these kinds of roles because I made my living for for years investigating as a Bail Enforcement Agent. My character jump starts the Greenwich Police investigation by delivering a case file. When a mysterious "man is a golden mask" comes to town, and attracts a cult of sex-crazed teens, I’m the one with the night-vision photographs. I really like my FBI character - his client is a super wealthy Greenwich heiress whose life is destroyed by her husband’s narcissism. Now, the thing you’ve got to realize about <span class="bold">True Drama</span> is that it’s more than just another crime story - it's also a Greek drama. And in Greek drama, when you tell the story of a family - say like <span class="bold">Medea</span> - you’re not just telling their story - but you’re also warning the State – the Democracy. </p>

aside: 'Strange Bacchic disturbances in the woods protesting a local horror movie prompt a police investigation. A shadowy figure emerges.  Calling himself the God of Drama, he believes that he can achieve the seemingly impossible goal of returning drama to its original purpose – of preparing citizens for leadership in democracy. As the horror movie spirals out of control, and the Bacchae are consumed in violence - can officer Ailish Walsh discern the truth before a gruesome Greek drama unfolds? <br><br> Director James Thomas creates a Greek tragedy for our time. A horror story that looks at the original role of drama – as the companion invention of democracy – to shed light on how modern media is still working in our lives, in hidden ways, to rip us apart. True Drama is an alarm – a rare moment of clarity – a terrifying jolt - and an invitation to enjoy the true transcendental power of drama to help us envision a better Democracy. '
