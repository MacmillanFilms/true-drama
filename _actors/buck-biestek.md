Buck Biestek - Bloodlust and Arsenic and Old Lace - was a shoe-in to play the retired FBI agent in True Drama. “I’m very comfortable in these kinds of roles because I made my living for years investigating as a Bail Enforcement Agent. My character jump starts the Greenwich Police investigation by delivering a case file. When a mysterious "man is a golden mask" comes to town, and attracts a cult of sex-crazed teens, I’m the one with the night-vision photographs. I really like my FBI character - his client is a super wealthy Greenwich heiress whose life is destroyed by her husband’s narcissism. Now, the thing you’ve got to realize about True Drama is that it’s more than just another crime story - it's also a Greek drama. And in Greek drama, when you tell the story of a family - say like Medea - you’re not just telling their story - but you’re also telling a metaphorical story about the state. So Medea is a story about the fake man of gold, Jason - and it’s a cautionary tale about demagogues in Democracy. True Drama is also operating on that level. So the film calls for a little detective work on the part of everyone.”
