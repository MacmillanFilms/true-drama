 <p class="text-white">David McLeod is a Greenwich, Connecticut actor who took on two roles - Greenwich SWAT and Greenwich Slasher.  He explains, “The original Greenwich Slasher lived in Greenwich in the 1980’s and wrote his manifesto while on death row. So the Slashers in this film are his disciples – we are trying to be like him. I have to admit, that the Slasher manifesto is a very scary book – and it features many familiar local landmarks like Todd’s Point. The Slasher masks are all hand-made out of Polymer clay and they have a very distinctive large frog or fish-like mouth. It’s a very sad mouth that also evokes being underwater because so much of the Slasher’s voyeurism was around water.”</p>
 
aside: 'Strange Bacchic disturbances in the woods protesting a local horror movie prompt a police investigation. A shadowy figure emerges.  Calling himself the God of Drama, he believes that he can achieve the seemingly impossible goal of returning drama to its original purpose – of preparing citizens for leadership in democracy. As the horror movie spirals out of control, and the Bacchae are consumed in violence - can officer Ailish Walsh discern the truth before a gruesome Greek drama unfolds? <br><br> Director James Thomas creates a Greek tragedy for our time. A horror story that looks at the original role of drama – as the companion invention of democracy – to shed light on how modern media is still working in our lives, in hidden ways, to rip us apart. True Drama is an alarm – a rare moment of clarity – a terrifying jolt - and an invitation to enjoy the true transcendental power of drama to help us envision a better Democracy. '
