 <p class="text-white">Speaking four languages, an expert rifle and pistol shot, and boasting an actor specialty focus in stage combat, kickboxing, and Budokai, Krajcovic was the perfect pick to play the seductively disarming Tanya. Tanya is a Bacchae and Mr. B’s girlfriend. She explains, “I loved playing the central Bacchae Tanya in True Drama. You’d think being in a love triangle between two narcissists would make me a victim, but it’s the opposite. The backstory of how the Dionysian cult first developed – with women asserting divine protection to their desire to go to the woods and do as they pleased – makes the Bacchae in this story imbued with supernatural self-agency.”</p>

aside: 'Strange Bacchic disturbances in the woods protesting a local horror movie prompt a police investigation. A shadowy figure emerges.  Calling himself the God of Drama, he believes that he can achieve the seemingly impossible goal of returning drama to its original purpose – of preparing citizens for leadership in democracy. As the horror movie spirals out of control, and the Bacchae are consumed in violence - can officer Ailish Walsh discern the truth before a gruesome Greek drama unfolds? <br><br> Director James Thomas creates a Greek tragedy for our time. A horror story that looks at the original role of drama – as the companion invention of democracy – to shed light on how modern media is still working in our lives, in hidden ways, to rip us apart. True Drama is an alarm – a rare moment of clarity – a terrifying jolt - and an invitation to enjoy the true transcendental power of drama to help us envision a better Democracy. '
