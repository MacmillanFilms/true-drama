 <p class="text-white">As an Amherst College and recent Actors Studio MFA graduate, Tatiana was a natural choice to take on the role of rooky Officer Walsh. Asked about the film, Tatiana explains, “I had just finished spending semesters of grad school studying Greek dramatic history and was very fresh with my sense of theatre and performance as being very community-driven and educational as much as it was entertaining. A lot of early drama is a highly emotional experience for both the performer and the audience; one of the reasons they never committed acts of violence on stage was the painful visceral effect it could have on the audience... When I had the chance to read the screenplay, I found it bore many similarities to theatre and appreciated the effort that went into the writing of such a story. I was certainly attached to the journey of Ailish, struggling to fill the shoes of a traditionally male career and living up to the personal expectations of her own role models without losing the sensitive qualities that make her a better human being. I'm very interested in projects that challenge an individual to find the balance of their own masculine and feminine qualities, as every human has and needs both, no matter what gender or sex you are. I think this film has a lot of play with those elements and explores how unhealthy we become without balance."</p>

aside: 'Strange Bacchic disturbances in the woods protesting a local horror movie prompt a police investigation. A shadowy figure emerges.  Calling himself the God of Drama, he believes that he can achieve the seemingly impossible goal of returning drama to its original purpose – of preparing citizens for leadership in democracy. As the horror movie spirals out of control, and the Bacchae are consumed in violence - can officer Ailish Walsh discern the truth before a gruesome Greek drama unfolds? <br><br> Director James Thomas creates a Greek tragedy for our time. A horror story that looks at the original role of drama – as the companion invention of democracy – to shed light on how modern media is still working in our lives, in hidden ways, to rip us apart. True Drama is an alarm – a rare moment of clarity – a terrifying jolt - and an invitation to enjoy the true transcendental power of drama to help us envision a better Democracy. '
