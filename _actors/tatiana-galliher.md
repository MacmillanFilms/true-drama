 <p class="text-white">As an Amherst College and recent Actors Studio MFA graduate, Tatiana Galliherwas a natural choice to take on the role of rooky Officer Walsh. Tatiana explains, “True Drama is two feature films happening at the same time. Walsh’s journey is a journey to find the truth – something we are all wrestling with these days.  The kind of solutions that she uses – the kind of answers that investigative police use: carefully collecting evidence, facts, firsthand testimony – these are exactly the right approach to discover truth. But there’s something else also going on in this film – it’s a Greek drama. The feature has all the elements – a Prologue, an Agon, an Exodus – and the effect of this is to shift the paradigm from entertainment to preparing citizens. This film upends how we think about drama. Actors today are kind of marginalized – it’s somehow not a serious profession – and this film kind of flips that on its head – gets you to realize that it can bevery important – even essential in a Democracy.”</p>

aside: 'Strange Bacchic disturbances in the woods protesting a local horror movie prompt a police investigation. A shadowy figure emerges.  Calling himself the God of Drama, he believes that he can achieve the seemingly impossible goal of returning drama to its original purpose – of preparing citizens for leadership in democracy. As the horror movie spirals out of control, and the Bacchae are consumed in violence - can officer Ailish Walsh discern the truth before a gruesome Greek drama unfolds? <br><br> Director James Thomas creates a Greek tragedy for our time. A horror story that looks at the original role of drama – as the companion invention of democracy – to shed light on how modern media is still working in our lives, in hidden ways, to rip us apart. True Drama is an alarm – a rare moment of clarity – a terrifying jolt - and an invitation to enjoy the true transcendental power of drama to help us envision a better Democracy. '
