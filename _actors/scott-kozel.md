 <p class="text-white">Scott Kozel is a well-known for playing criminals and mass murders. It’s no wonder, he’s 6'6"and gives himself entirely to playing the part of the lead Slasher Cane. Director James explains, "I asked Scott what kind of weapon he wants, and he knew immediately that he wanted a large karambit knife. He loves his work. Scott’s an English major from Drew University so he’s actually a very nice sensitive guy – but he loves to play monsters. "None of the literary irony of the Slaser Chant was wasted on Scott. He  chants the slasher chant from the movie, "Are we having fun? Yes!". <br><br> The Slasher Chant: <br> We hug our weapons! <br> We take what is ours! <br> We kill the defilers! <br> Are we committed? Yes! <br> Are we having fun? Yes! <br> Are we strong, powerful and dangerous? Yes! Yes! Yes!</p>

aside: 'Strange Bacchic disturbances in the woods protesting a local horror movie prompt a police investigation. A shadowy figure emerges.  Calling himself the God of Drama, he believes that he can achieve the seemingly impossible goal of returning drama to its original purpose – of preparing citizens for leadership in democracy. As the horror movie spirals out of control, and the Bacchae are consumed in violence - can officer Ailish Walsh discern the truth before a gruesome Greek drama unfolds? <br><br> Director James Thomas creates a Greek tragedy for our time. A horror story that looks at the original role of drama – as the companion invention of democracy – to shed light on how modern media is still working in our lives, in hidden ways, to rip us apart. True Drama is an alarm – a rare moment of clarity – a terrifying jolt - and an invitation to enjoy the true transcendental power of drama to help us envision a better Democracy. '
