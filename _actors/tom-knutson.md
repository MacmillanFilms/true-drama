 <p class="text-white">Tom Knutson,the veteran actor of contemporary and classical theater, played the Spartan Ambassador in the MacMillan Films staging of Lysistrata. The part of the Lawyer in True Drama was written with him in mind. These photos were taken during the police integration scene with Jack – played by Christopher Thomas. True Drama was Tom Knutson’s last feature film. Tom’s quiet charm made him magic to work with on and off camera. He is missed more than words can say. </p>

aside: 'Strange Bacchic disturbances in the woods protesting a local horror movie prompt a police investigation. A shadowy figure emerges.  Calling himself the God of Drama, he believes that he can achieve the seemingly impossible goal of returning drama to its original purpose – of preparing citizens for leadership in democracy. As the horror movie spirals out of control, and the Bacchae are consumed in violence - can officer Ailish Walsh discern the truth before a gruesome Greek drama unfolds? <br><br> Director James Thomas creates a Greek tragedy for our time. A horror story that looks at the original role of drama – as the companion invention of democracy – to shed light on how modern media is still working in our lives, in hidden ways, to rip us apart. True Drama is an alarm – a rare moment of clarity – a terrifying jolt - and an invitation to enjoy the true transcendental power of drama to help us envision a better Democracy. '
