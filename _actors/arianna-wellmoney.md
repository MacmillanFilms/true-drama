 <p class="text-white">Arianna Wellmoney is originally from Milan, Italy and is a graduate of The American Academy of Dramatic Arts. “I love how True Drama incorporates characters and themes from Greek drama. I was in Sophocles’ Antigone at the Queens Theater in New York and it’s amazing to experience how these works of art – created by the world’s first democracy – talk to modern audiences. True Drama is a Greek drama for today. The film forces us to look at how we use ‘reality’ in modern cinema. Reality is unpredictable, dangerous and interesting but we have to ask ourselves, where does this obsession take us? Does it lead to films about crime, war, prison and serial murderers? Hmmmm, and are we unintentionally glorifying violence. The Greek dramas use violence differently – they force us to think about injustice to launch us into a better realty – that’s what special about this film, it’s trying to do that also. I loved playing a Bacchae and I’m so proud to be a part of this movie.” </p>

aside: 'Strange Bacchic disturbances in the woods protesting a local horror movie prompt a police investigation. A shadowy figure emerges.  Calling himself the God of Drama, he believes that he can achieve the seemingly impossible goal of returning drama to its original purpose – of preparing citizens for leadership in democracy. As the horror movie spirals out of control, and the Bacchae are consumed in violence - can officer Ailish Walsh discern the truth before a gruesome Greek drama unfolds? <br><br> Director James Thomas creates a Greek tragedy for our time. A horror story that looks at the original role of drama – as the companion invention of democracy – to shed light on how modern media is still working in our lives, in hidden ways, to rip us apart. True Drama is an alarm – a rare moment of clarity – a terrifying jolt - and an invitation to enjoy the true transcendental power of drama to help us envision a better Democracy. '
