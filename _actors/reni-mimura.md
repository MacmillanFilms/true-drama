 <p class="text-white">Pop singer sensation, Reni Mimura, plays the horror movie Production Manager in True Drama. “I enjoyed my role because it was both cute and innocent - and cruel and scary - all at the same time.” Reni continues, “But True Drama is more than just a scary movie, it explores why violence is used in film. Violence can be used as a thrill and it can be used more thoughtfully as an alarm bell to change behavior. There’s a lot of violence in media – and women are often the target of that violence - and it’s good to have a film that lets you step back and look at why that is.”</p>

aside: 'Strange Bacchic disturbances in the woods protesting a local horror movie prompt a police investigation. A shadowy figure emerges.  Calling himself the God of Drama, he believes that he can achieve the seemingly impossible goal of returning drama to its original purpose – of preparing citizens for leadership in democracy. As the horror movie spirals out of control, and the Bacchae are consumed in violence - can officer Ailish Walsh discern the truth before a gruesome Greek drama unfolds? <br><br> Director James Thomas creates a Greek tragedy for our time. A horror story that looks at the original role of drama – as the companion invention of democracy – to shed light on how modern media is still working in our lives, in hidden ways, to rip us apart. True Drama is an alarm – a rare moment of clarity – a terrifying jolt - and an invitation to enjoy the true transcendental power of drama to help us envision a better Democracy. '
