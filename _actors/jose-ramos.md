 <p class="text-white">Jose Ramos plays Detective Oliva in True Drama. It’s not the first time he’s been cast as a detective. With 19 years in the fire service and now a captain, he knows first-hand about the challenges and stress of being a first responder. He explains, “I was excited to do this film because it’s a crime mystery with the premise that all drama is instructive. It was fun to explore and take the audience on a journey of figuring this case out. The main story is about how the police are in a race to contain the violence created by media and inflamed by forces that we are racing to understand. Along the way I get to mentor a rookie female officer while we deal with super-natural stress. Everything about this film will keep you guessing … and get you thinking.” </p>

aside: 'Strange Bacchic disturbances in the woods protesting a local horror movie prompt a police investigation. A shadowy figure emerges.  Calling himself the God of Drama, he believes that he can achieve the seemingly impossible goal of returning drama to its original purpose – of preparing citizens for leadership in democracy. As the horror movie spirals out of control, and the Bacchae are consumed in violence - can officer Ailish Walsh discern the truth before a gruesome Greek drama unfolds? <br><br> Director James Thomas creates a Greek tragedy for our time. A horror story that looks at the original role of drama – as the companion invention of democracy – to shed light on how modern media is still working in our lives, in hidden ways, to rip us apart. True Drama is an alarm – a rare moment of clarity – a terrifying jolt - and an invitation to enjoy the true transcendental power of drama to help us envision a better Democracy. '
