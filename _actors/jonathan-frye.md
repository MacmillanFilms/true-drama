 <p class="text-white">With Degrees from George Mason University and La Conservatoire Libre du Cinema Francais in Paris France, and an acting background in stage combat, Jonathan was an easy casting choice for the role of Greenwich SWAT. Jonathan explains, “In True Drama the police officers have to deal with the real-world trauma of encountering the dangerous god of panic fear - Dionysos. I enjoyed being SWAT and portraying the real issues police face doing their jobs under the stress of panic fear. </p> <p class="text-white">To find out more about Jonathan, visit <a href="https://jonathanwfrye.wixsite.com/jonathan" target="_blank" class="underline mail-link">www.jonathanwfrye.wixsite.com/jonathan</a></p>

aside: 'Strange Bacchic disturbances in the woods protesting a local horror movie prompt a police investigation. A shadowy figure emerges.  Calling himself the God of Drama, he believes that he can achieve the seemingly impossible goal of returning drama to its original purpose – of preparing citizens for leadership in democracy. As the horror movie spirals out of control, and the Bacchae are consumed in violence - can officer Ailish Walsh discern the truth before a gruesome Greek drama unfolds? <br><br> Director James Thomas creates a Greek tragedy for our time. A horror story that looks at the original role of drama – as the companion invention of democracy – to shed light on how modern media is still working in our lives, in hidden ways, to rip us apart. True Drama is an alarm – a rare moment of clarity – a terrifying jolt - and an invitation to enjoy the true transcendental power of drama to help us envision a better Democracy. '
