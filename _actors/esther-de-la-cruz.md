 <p class="text-white">Esther de la Cruz played a Bacchae in True Drama where she led the actors in warm-up thanks to her dance background. The set photography shows her goofing around with the other actors between takes. “It was great fun to play on Stage with Dionysos. I have always wanted to play a Bacchae – they are wild and strong and independent – and they like to dance,” she explains with a smile. “It was wonderful to be in this film.  It was so fun to shoot and it makes you think - about the bigger role that drama could play in Democracy.” Esther de la Cruz is a New York actor/singer/choreographer with a B.F.A. in Musical Theater from Carmen Roche in Spain - and a graduate of the PeiridanceCapezio Center. </p>

aside: 'Strange Bacchic disturbances in the woods protesting a local horror movie prompt a police investigation. A shadowy figure emerges.  Calling himself the God of Drama, he believes that he can achieve the seemingly impossible goal of returning drama to its original purpose – of preparing citizens for leadership in democracy. As the horror movie spirals out of control, and the Bacchae are consumed in violence - can officer Ailish Walsh discern the truth before a gruesome Greek drama unfolds? <br><br> Director James Thomas creates a Greek tragedy for our time. A horror story that looks at the original role of drama – as the companion invention of democracy – to shed light on how modern media is still working in our lives, in hidden ways, to rip us apart. True Drama is an alarm – a rare moment of clarity – a terrifying jolt - and an invitation to enjoy the true transcendental power of drama to help us envision a better Democracy. '
