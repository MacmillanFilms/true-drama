 <p class="text-white">Heather Gault is a versatile actress who graduated from the University of Southern Californian before earning her Master of Art from the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland. Heather has starred in the MacMillan Films movie of Lysistrata and plays the mysterious leader Bacchae Zenobia. She explains, “True Drama is a Greek drama. It has all the elements – a Prologue, an Agon, an Exodus – and the effect of this is to shift the paradigm from entertainment to preparing citizens. This film upends how we think about drama. Actors today are kind of marginalized – it’s somehow not a serious profession – and this film kind of flips that on its head – gets you to realize that it can be very important – even essential in a Democracy.” </p> <p class="text-white">You can find out more about Heather, visit <a href="https://www.heather-hurst.com/" target="_blank" class="underline mail-link">www.heather-hurst.com</a></p>

aside: 'Strange Bacchic disturbances in the woods protesting a local horror movie prompt a police investigation. A shadowy figure emerges.  Calling himself the God of Drama, he believes that he can achieve the seemingly impossible goal of returning drama to its original purpose – of preparing citizens for leadership in democracy. As the horror movie spirals out of control, and the Bacchae are consumed in violence - can officer Ailish Walsh discern the truth before a gruesome Greek drama unfolds? <br><br> Director James Thomas creates a Greek tragedy for our time. A horror story that looks at the original role of drama – as the companion invention of democracy – to shed light on how modern media is still working in our lives, in hidden ways, to rip us apart. True Drama is an alarm – a rare moment of clarity – a terrifying jolt - and an invitation to enjoy the true transcendental power of drama to help us envision a better Democracy. '
