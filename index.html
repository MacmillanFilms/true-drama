        <p class="text-white">Strange Bacchic disturbances in the woods protesting a local horror movie prompt a
          police investigation. A shadowy figure emerges. Calling himself the God of Drama, he believes that he can
          achieve the seemingly impossible goal of returning drama to its original purpose – of preparing citizens for
          leadership in democracy. As the horror movie spirals out of control, and the Bacchae are consumed in
          violence - can officer Ailish Walsh discern the truth before a gruesome Greek drama unfolds?</p>
        <p class="text-white">Director James Thomas creates a Greek tragedy for our time. A horror story that looks at
          the original role of drama – as the companion invention of democracy – to shed light on how modern media is
          still working in our lives, in hidden ways, to rip us apart. True Drama is an alarm – a rare moment of
          clarity – a terrifying jolt - and an invitation to enjoy the true transcendental power of drama to help us
          envision a better Democracy. </p>
